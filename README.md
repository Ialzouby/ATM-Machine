# ATM-Machine
ATM machine that allows the user to deposit/withdraw/view a checking and saving account registered under a predefined customer number and pin! 



(Notes listed below are to track my progress throughout the future. To my peers: I highly reccomend this, it has helped me drastically. Not only does the documented progress reinforce the learning process but it also helps identify my weaknesses and topics that I need to review!)

Personal project #2 
Had the opportunity to practice IOExceptions and try catch statements
Used the decimal formater for the first time, I used this to format the input into USD format!
Had my first experience with a HashMap: Not too familiar yet!

Interesting Note: I typically have all my prompts and menu coded into the main method, for this project I created methods in the Menu class that I later called through the main method. Gives a cleaner look, did require the implementation of inheritance!
